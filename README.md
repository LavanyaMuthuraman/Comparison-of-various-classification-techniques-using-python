Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. 
It refers to the automated detection of meaningful patterns in data. Machine learning tools are concerned with endowing programs with the ability to learn and adapt. 
Machine Learning has become one of the mainstays of Information Technology and with that, a rather central, albeit usually hidden, part of our life. 
With the ever-increasing amounts of data becoming available there is a good reason to believe that smart data analysis will become even more 
pervasive as a necessary ingredient for technological progress. There are several applications for Machine Learning (ML), the most significant of which is data mining. People are often prone to making mistakes during 
analyses or, possibly, when trying to establish relationships between multiple features. Machine learning uses a variety of algorithms that iteratively learn from data to improve, 
describe data, and predict outcomes. As the algorithms ingest training data, it is then possible to produce more precise models based on that data. 
A machine learning model is the output generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with data. After training, when you provide a model with an input, you will be given an output. 
For example, a predictive algorithm will create a predictive model. Then, when you provide the predictive model with data, you will receive a prediction based on the data that trained the model.
We likely interact with machine learning applications without realizing. For example, when we visit an e-commerce site and start viewing products and reading reviews, we’re likely presented 
with other, similar products that we may find interesting. These recommendations aren’t hard coded by an army of developers. The suggestions are served to the site via a machine learning 
model. The model ingests our browsing history along with other shoppers’ browsing and purchasing data in order to present other similar products that we may want to purchase.


In this project, we used different classification models to check whether the different training size affect the model accuracy.
